You can force a backreference interpretation always by using the C<\g{...}>
form.  You can the force an octal interpretation always by using the C<\o{...}>
form, or for numbers up through \077 (= 63 decimal), by using three digits,
beginning with a "0".

=head3 Hexadecimal escapes

Like octal escapes, there are two forms of hexadecimal escapes, but both start
with the sequence C<\x>.  This is followed by either exactly two hexadecimal
digits forming a number, or a hexadecimal number of arbitrary length surrounded
by curly braces. The hexadecimal number is the code point of the character you
want to express.

Note that a character expressed as one of these escapes is considered a
character without special meaning by the regex engine, and will match
"as is".

Mnemonic: heI<x>adecimal.

 $str = "Perl";
 $str =~ /\x50/;    # Match, "\x50" is "P".
 $str =~ /\x50+/;   # Match, "\x50" is "P", it is repeated at least on
