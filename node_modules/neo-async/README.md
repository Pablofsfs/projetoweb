s crashing IDLE if there was an
  option in config-extensions w/o a value. Patch #1672481, Tal Einat

- Corrected some bugs in AutoComplete.  Also, Page Up/Down in ACW implemented;
  mouse and cursor selection in ACWindow implemented; double Tab inserts
  current selection and closes ACW (similar to double-click and Return); scroll
  wheel now works in ACW.  Added AutoComplete instructions to IDLE Help.

- AutoCompleteWindow moved below input line, will move above if there
  isn't enough space.  Patch 1621265 Tal Einat

- Calltips now 'handle' tuples in the argument list (display '<tuple>' :)
  Suggested solution by Christos Georgiou, Bug 791968.

- Add 'raw' support to configHandler. Patch 1650174 Tal Einat.

- Avoid hang when encountering a duplicate in a completion list. Bug 1571112.

- Patch #1362975: Rework CodeContext indentation algorithm to
  avoid hard-coding pixel widths.

- Bug #813342: Start the IDLE subprocess with -Qnew if the parent
  is started with that option.

- Honor the "Cancel" action in the save dialog (Debian bug #299092)

- Some syntax errors were being caught by tokenize during the tabnanny
  check, resulting in obscure error messages.  Do the syntax check
  first.  Bug 1562716, 1562719

- IDLE's version number takes a big jump to match the version number of
  the Python release of which it's a part.


What's New in IDLE 1.2?
=======================
*Release date: 19-SEP-2006*

- File menu hotkeys: there were three 'p' assignments.  Reassign the
  'Save Copy As' and 'Print' hotkeys to 'y' and 't'.  Change the
  Shell hotkey from 's' to 'l'.

- IDLE honors new quit() and exit() commands from site.py Quitter() object.
  Patch 1540892, Jim Jewett

- The 'with' statement is now a Code Context block opener.
  Patch 1540851, Jim Jewett

- Retrieval of previous shell command was not always preserving indentation
  (since 1.2a1) Patch 1528468 Tal Einat.

- Changing tokenize (39046) to detect dedent broke tabnanny check (since 1.2a1)

- ToggleTab dialog was setting indent to 8 even if cancelled (since 1.2a1).

- When used w/o subprocess, all exceptions were preceded by an error
  message claiming they were IDLE internal errors (since 1.2a1).

- Bug #1525817: Don't truncate short lines in IDLE's tool tips.

- Bug #1517990: IDLE keybindings on MacOS X now work correctly

- Bug #1517996: IDLE now longer shows the default Tk menu when a
  path browser, class browser or debugger is the frontmost window on MacOS X

- EditorWindow.test() was failing.  Bug 1417598

- EditorWindow failed when used stand-alone if sys.ps1 not set.
  Bug 1010370 Dave Florek

- Tooltips failed on new-syle class __init__ args.  Bug 1027566 Loren Guthrie

- Avoid occasional failure to detect closing paren properly.
  Patch 1407280 Tal Einat

- Rebinding Tab key was inserting 'tab' instead of 'Tab'.  Bug 1179168.

- Colorizer now handles #<builtin> correctly, also unicode strings and
  'as' keyword in comment directly following import command. Closes 1325071.
  Patch 1479219 Tal Einat

- Patch #1162825: Support non-ASCII characters in IDLE window titles.

- Source file f.flush() after writing; trying to avoid lossage if user
  kills GUI.

- Options / Keys / Advanced dialog made functional.  Also, allow binding
  of 'movement' keys.

- 'syntax' patch adds improved calltips and a new class attribute listbox.
  MultiCall module allows binding multiple actions to an event.
  Patch 906702 Noam Raphael

- Better indentation after first line of string continuation.
  IDLEfork Patch 681992, Noam Raphael

- Fixed CodeContext alignment problem, following suggestion from Tal Einat.

- Increased performance in CodeContext extension  Patch 936169 Noam Raphael

- Mac line endings were incorrect when pasting code from some browsers
  when using X11 and the Fink distribution.  Python Bug 1263656.

- <Enter> when cursor is on a previous command retrieves that command.  Instead
  of replacing the input line, the previous command is now appended to the
  input line. Indentation is preserved, and undo is enabled.
  Patch 1196917  Jeff Shute

- Clarify "tab/space" Error Dialog and "Tab Width" Dialog associated with
  the Untabify command.

- Corrected "tab/space" Error Dialog to show correct menu for Untabify.
  Patch 1196980 Jeff Shute

- New files are colorized by default, and colorizing is removed when
  saving as non-Python files. Patch 1196895 Jeff Shute
  Closes Python Bugs 775012 and 800432, partial fix IDLEfork 763524

- Improve subprocess link error notification.

- run.py: use Queue's blocking feature instead of sleeping in the main
  loop.  Patch # 1190163 Michiel de Hoon

- Add config-main option to make the 'history' feature non-cyclic.
  Default remains cyclic.  Python Patch 914546 Noam Raphael.

- Removed ability to configure tabs indent from Options dialog.  This 'feature'
  has never worked and no one has complained.  It is still possible to set a
  default tabs (v. spaces) indent 'manually' via config-main.def (or to turn on
  tabs for the current EditorWindow via the Format menu) but IDLE will
  encourage indentation via spaces.

- Enable setting the indentation width using the Options dialog.
  Bug # 783877

- Add keybindings for del-word-left and del-word-right.

- Discourage using an indent width other than 8 when using tabs to indent
  Python code.

- Restore use of EditorWindow.set_indentation_params(), was dead code since
  Autoindent was merged into EditorWindow.  This allows IDLE to conform to the
  indentation width of a loaded file.  (But it still will not switch to tabs
  even if the file uses tabs.)  Any change in indent width is local to that
  window.

- Add Tabnanny check before Run/F5, not just when Checking module.

- If an extension can't be loaded, print warning and skip it instead of
  erroring out.

- Improve error handling when .idlerc can't be created (warn and exit).

- The GUI was hanging if the shell window was closed while a raw_input()
  was pending.  Restored the quit() of the readline() mainloop().
  http://mail.python.org/pipermail/idle-dev/2004-December/002307.html

- The remote procedure call module rpc.py can now access data attributes of
  remote registered objects.  Changes to these attributes are local, however.


What's New in IDLE 1.1?
=======================
*Release date: 30-NOV-2004*

- On OpenBSD, terminating IDLE with ctrl-c from the command line caused a
  stuck subprocess MainThread because only the SocketThread was exiting.

- Saving a Keyset w/o making changes (by using the "Save as New Custom Key Set"
  button) caused IDLE to fail on restart (no new keyset was created in
  config-keys.cfg).  Also true for Theme/highlights.  Python Bug 1064535.

- A change to the linecache.py API caused IDLE to exit when an exception was
  raised while running without the subprocess (-n switch).  Python Bug 1063840.

- When paragraph reformat width was made configurable, a bug was
  introduced that caused reformatting of comment blocks to ignore how
  far the block was indented, effectively adding the indentation width
  to the reformat width.  This has been repaired, and the reformat
  width is again a bound on the total width of reformatted lines.

- Improve keyboard focus binding, especially in Windows menu.  Improve
  window raising, especially in the Windows menu and in the debugger.
  IDLEfork 763524.

- If user passes a non-existent filename on the commandline, just
  open a new file, don't raise a dialog.  IDLEfork 854928.

- EditorWindow.py was not finding the .chm help file on Windows.  Typo
  at Rev 1.54.  Python Bug 990954

- checking sys.platform for substring 'win' was breaking IDLE docs on Mac
  (darwin).  Also, Mac Safari browser requires full file:// URIs.  SF 900580.

- Redirect the warning stream to the shell during the ScriptBinding check of
  user code and format the warning similarly to an exception for both that
  check and for runtime warnings raised in the subprocess.

- CodeContext hint pane visibility state is now persistent across sessions.
  The pane no longer appears in the shell window.  Added capability to limit
  extensions to shell window or editor windows.  Noam Raphael addition
  to Patch 936169.

- Paragraph reformat width is now a configurable parameter in the
  Options GUI.

- New Extension: CodeContext.  Provides block structuring hints for code
  which has scrolled above an edit window. Patch 936169 Noam Raphael.

- If nulls somehow got into the strings in recent-files.lst
  EditorWindow.update_recent_files_list() was failing.  Python Bug 931336.

- If the normal background is changed via Configure/Highlighting, it will
  update immediately, thanks to the previously mentioned patch by Nigel Rowe.

- Add a highlight theme for builtin keywords.  Python Patch 805830 Nigel Rowe
  This also fixed IDLEfork bug [ 693418 ] Normal text background color not
  refreshed and Python bug [897872 ] Unknown color name on HP-UX

- rpc.py:SocketIO - Large modules were generating large pickles when downloaded
  to the execution server.  The return of the OK response from the subprocess
  initialization was interfering and causing the sending socket to be not
  ready.  Add an IO ready test to fix this.  Moved the polling IO ready test
  into pollpacket().

- Fix typo in rpc.py, s/b "pickle.PicklingError" not "pickle.UnpicklingError".

- Added a Tk error dialog to run.py inform the user if the subprocess can't
  connect to the user GUI process.  Added a timeout to the GUI's listening
  socket.  Added Tk error dialogs to PyShell.py to announce a failure to bind
  the port or connect to the subprocess.  Clean up error handling during
  connection initiation phase.  This is an update of Python Patch 778323.

- Print correct exception even if source file changed since shell was
  restarted.  IDLEfork Patch 869012 Noam Raphael

- Keybindings with the Shift modifier now work correctly.  So do bindings which
  use the Space key.  Limit unmodified user keybindings to the function keys.
  Python Bug 775353, IDLEfork Bugs 755647, 761557

- After an exception, run.py was not setting the exception vector. Noam
  Raphael suggested correcting this so pdb's postmortem pm() would work.
  IDLEfork Patch 844675

- IDLE now does not fail to save the file anymore if the Tk buffer is not a
  Unicode string, yet eol_convention is.  Python Bugs 774680, 788378

- IDLE didn't start correctly when Python was installed in "Program Files" on
  W2K and XP.  Python Bugs 780451, 784183

- config-main.def documentation incorrectly referred to idle- instead of
  config-  filenames.  SF 782759  Also added note about .idlerc location.


What's New in IDLE 1.0?
=======================
*Release date: 29-Jul-2003*

- Added a banner to the shell discussing warnings possibly raised by personal
  firewall software.  Added same comment to README.txt.

- Calltip error when docstring was None  Python Bug 775541

- Updated extend.txt, help.txt, and config-extensions.def to correctly
  reflect the current status of the configuration system.  Python Bug 768469

- Fixed: Call Tip Trimming May Loop Forever. Python Patch 769142 (Daniels)

- Replaced apply(f, args, kwds) with f(*args, **kwargs) to improve performance
  Python Patch 768187

- Break or continue statements outside a loop were causing IDLE crash
  Python Bug 767794

- Convert Unicode strings from readline to IOBinding.encoding.  Also set
  sys.std{in|out|err}.encoding, for both the local and the subprocess case.
  SF IDLEfork patch 682347.

- Extend AboutDialog.ViewFile() to support file encodings.  Make the CREDITS
  file Latin-1.

- Updated the About dialog to reflect re-integration into Python.  Provide
  buttons to display Python's NEWS, License, and Credits, plus additional
  buttons for IDLE's README and NEWS.

- TextViewer() now has a third parameter which allows inserting text into the
  viewer instead of reading from a file.

- (Created the .../Lib/idlelib directory in the Python CVS, which is a clone of
  IDLEfork modified to install in the Python environment.  The code in the
  interrupt module has been moved to thread.interrupt_main(). )

- Printing the Shell window was failing if it was not saved first SF 748975

- When using the Search in Files dialog, if the user had a selection
