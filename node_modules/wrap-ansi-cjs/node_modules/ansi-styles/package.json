sable auto-ending behavior for a hub. The auto-ending
behavior is triggered by an end block and is used to cull IPC events, and
output the final plan if the plan was 'NO PLAN'.

=item $bool = $hub->active

=item $hub->set_active($bool)

These are used to get/set the 'active' attribute. When true this attribute will
force C<< hub->finalize() >> to take action even if there is no plan, and no
tests have been run. This flag is useful for plugins that add follow-up
behaviors that need to run even if no events are seen.

=head2 STATE METHODS

=over 4

=item $hub->reset_state()

Reset all state to the start. This sets the test count to 0, clears the plan,
removes the failures, etc.

=item $num = $hub->count

Get the number of tests that have been run.

=item $num = $hub->failed

Get the number of failures (Not all failures come from a test fail, so this
number can be larger than the count).

=item $bool = $hub->ended

True if the testing has ended. This MAY return the stack frame of the tool that
ended the test, but that is not guarantee
