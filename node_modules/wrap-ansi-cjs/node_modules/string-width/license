=item C<\b{sb}>

This matches a Unicode "Sentence Boundary".  This is an aid to parsing
natural language sentences.  It gives good, but imperfect results.  For
example, it thinks that "Mr. Smith" is two sentences.  More details are
at L<https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/>.  Note also that it thinks
that anything matching L</\R> (except form feed and vertical tab) is a
sentence boundary.  C<\b{sb}> works with text designed for
word-processors which wrap lines
automatically for display, but hard-coded line boundaries are considered
to be essentially the ends of text blocks (paragraphs really), and hence
the ends of sentences.  C<\b{sb}> doesn't do well with text containing
embedded newlines, like the source text of the document you are reading.
Such text needs to be preprocessed to get rid of the line separators
before looking for sentence boundaries.  Some people view this as a bug
in the Unicode standard, and this behavior is quite subject to change in
future Perl versions.

This matches a Unicode "Word Boundary", but tailored to Perl
